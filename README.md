## Introduction
Relations between the United States of America (U.S.A) and People's Republic of China have caught much international attention during the past decade. Due to the increased importance of the latter and the tensions between the two actors, the topic was a top priority in U.S.A's national security conversation. Some of the thought leaders of the Republican party even called the advent of a New Cold war (Carafano, 2023) between the two geopolitical powers of the moment. Considering the political sciences relavance of the subject, our group has chosen to focus on U.S.A-China relations coverage by the New York Times from 2009 to 2020.

The time period of 2009-2020 has been chosen for several reasons: 1) It is large enough to show a pertienent time evolution, but short enough to be covered in detail; 2) it covers three _finished_ presidential terms, allowing for comparison between them; 3) and it covers a recent period, but with enough distance to do so retrospectively.

The New York Times newspaper has been chosen considering its accessibility, but also its consistent adherence to high editorial standards, as evidenced by the numerous Pulitzer Prizes. Moreover, its reputation as a reliable and influential source positions it as a noteworthy contributor to the discourse on global affairs. Its ability to capture a wide range of viewpoints and narratives that have shaped perceptions of the China-U.S.A. relationship over time. Furthermore, by recognizing The New York Times' center-left editorial stance, we affirm our commitment to acknowledge potential bias, while appreciating the newspaper's unique insights.

In our research, our goal is to provide valuable insights into the reciprocal relationship between media portrayals, particularly from influential sources such as The New York Times, and the dynamic nature of China-U.S. relations. By acknowledging the substantial influence of the newspaper, both within the U.S.A. and globally, we seek to illuminate its role in shaping public opinion and reflecting prevailing sentiments within society.  

In addition, our aim is to capture the diverse narratives and perspectives that have molded our understanding of this pivotal geopolitical relationship over time. Through this exploration, we strive to contribute insights into how media portrayals, especially from influential sources like The New York Times, have not only mirrored but also influenced the evolving nature of China-U.S.A. relations. This endeavor offers a valuable lens through which to comprehend the intricate complexities of this vital global partnership. Our approach remains thoughtful and inclusive as we navigate the complexities of this global partnership, recognizing the multifaceted nature of media influence. Through this exploration, we aim to provide a thorough and valuable perspective on the evolving narratives surrounding China-U.S. relations, adding depth and context to our research endeavor.
## Literature review
The great power competition between the US and China is without a doubt one of the most pressing issues of governance today. Even before the 2000s, the economic relations between the two actors have been described as "troubled" (Noland, 1996), and their dynamics was already pivoting as the most complex challenge of the 21st century. Today, in this strategic conversation, the future of liberal internationalism (De Graaff and Van Apeldoorn, 2018) as we know it it's at stake, and the world dynamics are already massively influenced by the emergence of China as a global power and the way US is reacting to this challenge.  

In the aftermath of Barack Obama's inauguration on January 20, 2009, the initial years of his presidential term were characterized by a prevailing positive sentiment in U.S.-China relations. During this period, media portrayals of China generally leaned toward the favorable, reflecting a climate of cooperation and mutual understanding between the two nations. Although the bilateral trade relations had grown in those years, the same period was marked by a trigger in the US policy debate caused by the fact that China refused to adopt a floating currency and failed to implement a series of its obligations as part of the World Trade Organization, especially the ones regarding intellectual propriety rights. Members in the Congress, especially the Republican ones, had urged the Obama administration for tougher stances against China's economic irresponsibility for eliminating the economic policies that were considered to be antagonizing with the interests of US (Morrison, 2008).  

The academic debate has often associated this conundum by distinguishing between a power transition and a hegemonic succession, especially since China is considered to be the most persistent challenge at US' hegemony since the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union (Clark, 2011). The "strategic distrust" (Lieberthal and Jisi, 2012) between the two economic challengers appeared in the American national security debate environment long before we have seen actual de-risking direct measures that lead the bilateral relation. For the policy makers in the United States, the growing military investment, the strategic ambiguity in the Asia-Pacific, coupled with lack of transparency and willingness to signal clear foreign policy interests was particular worrisome. Furthermore, the fact that although Chinese economy growth was stellar (about the same time when US experienced significant difficulties to cope after the international financial crisis in 2008), the lack of prospectives for political reform was more difficult to grasp.  

However, a palpable shift in diplomatic dynamics occurred with the transition to the Trump administration. In 2017, the promotion of a new national security strategy brought important amendments to the bilateral vocabulary with China being labeled as a “revisionist power” (Zhao, 2019), and US ready to enter a novel era of strategic competition. The advent of the Trade War and the multifaceted challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic introduced a discernible transformation in how China was depicted in the media. This period marked an evolution in U.S.-China relations, portraying a landscape that was not only complex but at times contentious under President Trump's leadership. 2018 was a particular important moment in the relation of the these two world largest economic powers (Itakura, 2020), notably due to the fact that they have imposed harsh import tariffs against the other, which lead to the reduce of a variety of sectoral imports to the US and China. Trade conflicts between US and China had a growing impact on most countries, especially in GDP and manufacturing employment, albeit it benefited their welfare and trade (Li, He and Lin, 2018). This trade war was not limited to import tariffs or economic relations in general, but involved new limits on high-tech products, political competition and a diplomatic polarization with worldwide effects. The protectionist trade approach of the US under Trump presidency has been cited as the "policy of national egoism within the framework of the economic patriotism" (Kapustina et al., 2020), in which the sole economic interests of the American nation Donald Trump aimed to restored were a more important priority than the interests of the partners and the obligations derived from multilateralism. Following the conclusion of Trump's presidency, Joe Biden assumed office with a diplomatic approach that aimed to soften relations with China. 
## Methodology and corpus consolidation
Our investigation spans covers the Obama administration since 2009 and the two following Trump administrations, with the goal of understanding the trends in which the US-China relations are portrayed. The timeliness of this research is bolstered by the fact that it follows a US-China summit, considered to be one of the most important political events of the calendar year, and it precedes the electoral year in the US.   
### Methodological choices
We chose to divide the data into corpuses because..
### Corpus consolidation
The keywords were: 
The period of time was:
## Frequencies
### Most frequent words
### Most frequent people
In this analysis, we turn our attention to the five most frequently mentioned individuals by year in a corpus of news articles from 2009 to 2020. Leveraging Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques, we identify and quantify the occurrences of these prominent figures, shedding light on the dynamics of media attention. The outcomes of our analysis offer a mix of anticipated findings and unexpected discoveries. 

The analysis shows that the most mentioned persons are the US presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump. This expected high frequency of their occurrence in the articles aligns with their pivotal roles in shaping global affairs and commanding considerable public attention. However, the name “Donald Trump” is mentioned much more times than the name “Barack Obama” which may have been caused by the global situation. While the US-China relations during the Obama presidency were mostly cooperative and peaceful, their relations significantly worsened during the Trump presidency. During Trump's presidency, we can observe the onset of the great power competition and US-China relations became a higher-priority topic for the media.

Their respective US Secretaries of State, Hillary Clinton and Rex Tillerson, also have generally high occurrences in the articles which underscores the critical role that key officials play in shaping and influencing US-China relations. This consistent high profile of Secretaries of State as well as other key officials such as former US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in the articles signifies their integral contribution to diplomatic endeavors and their high impact on the discourse surrounding the U.S.-China relations. 

Chinese president Xi Jinping is mentioned primarily from the year 2013, when he became president of the People's Republic of China. However, his name is mentioned much less than the names of the US presidents which might have been caused by the bias of the New York Times as the american newspaper. 

However, as the data reveals, key Chinese and US political figures are not the only drivers of US-China relations. We can observe several actors from third countries and non-official actors as well. In 2009, one of the most mentioned names was former US president Richard Nixon. This is connected to the effort of the then US president Barack Obama, who endeavored to strengthen relations with China—a diplomatic initiative reminiscent of the endeavors undertaken by Richard Nixon in the 1970s. The media compared Obama's efforts to Nixon's.

We can see two key persons who significantly influenced US-China relations even though they had no political role. One of them is Chen Guangcheng, a civil rights activist persecuted in China, who fled to the US embassy in Beijing. He was a subject of several negotiations between the US and China. The other is Edward Snowden, an American whistleblower, who leaked highly classified information. He fled to Hong Kong where he spent several weeks following his actions.

The data also reveals which countries play a major role in the US-China relations. It is North Korea, India, Japan, Venezuela, Russia (in later years) and Philippines. Their leaders regularly occur among the 5 most mentioned people by year in the corpus.

## Topic modelling
Topic modelling has been realised on both the corpus encompassing all the articles and on each terms' corpus. We have chosen to create 15 topics, since it is a number precise enough to have well-defined topics, but small enough to allow analysis. 

> [The lists will all the assigned topics for the three corpuses are available in the document _Topic modelling.pdf_](https://github.com/jancipar/US-China-relations/blob/main/Topic%20modelling.pdf "Topic modelling.pdf")

 See the document Topic_modelling.pdf to 

Several topics appeared in all or most of the topic modellings:
- Russia-related security issues
- Finance and economy, mainly USA's
- Climate change
- Iran and nuclear weapons
- Technology and Huawei   

Some people, as Hillary Clinton and Mike Pompeo, were so mentionned that they could even be categorised as a topic themselves.

## Sentiment distribution
The sentiment analysis has been done using Bert. Its interest for this analysis is on the fact that it shows the positive, negative or neutral connotations attached to the U.S.A-China relations by article. As such, it might help in the understanding of general trends and evolutions through the different presidential terms.

> [The code used to do the sentiment analysis can be found in the document _Sentiment analysis_Bert.ipynb_](https://github.com/jancipar/US-China-relations/blob/main/Sentiment_analysis_Bert.ipynb "Sentiment_analysis_Bert.ipynb")

The first sentiment analysis realised covers the entirety of the corpus, from 2009 to 2020 (see Figure below). It shows that 46,26 % of all articles were negative, 10,9% positive and 42,84 % neutral. These results came as unsuprising to us: during the covered period, both the tense U.S.A.-China relation and China's politics have not been presented under a flattening light to the U.S.A public. The high percentage of neutral articles may depict the technical character of their relations on some subjects, but also The New York Times' unsensational approach to most topics.

In accordance with the first sentiment analysis, the second and more detailed one shows that the predominance of negative articles over the positive ones can be observed over the whole period 2009-2021. However, we can observe a significant increase of negative articles from the year 2016 which coincides with the onset of Trump's presidency. While the proportion of negative articles was around or below 40 % from 2009 to 2015, it was steadily over 40 % from 2016, reaching 66,7 % in 2021. We can also observe a decline in the share of positive and neutral articles. While from 2009 to 2016 the proportion of positive articles was around 12 %, it was mostly below 10 % from 2016. From 2009 to 2016, the share of neutral articles was around 50 %, but there is a stark decline from 2016. The analysis shows that the news coverage was mostly negative, especially since the beginning of Trump's presidency, when relations between the US and China deteriorated significantly.
