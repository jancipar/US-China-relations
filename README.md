In this analysis, we turn our attention to the five most frequently mentioned individuals by year in a corpus of news articles from 2009 to 2020. Leveraging Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques, we identify and quantify the occurrences of these prominent figures, shedding light on the dynamics of media attention. The outcomes of our analysis offer a mix of anticipated findings and unexpected discoveries. 

The analysis shows that the most mentioned persons are the US presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump. This expected high frequency of their occurrence in the articles aligns with their pivotal roles in shaping global affairs and commanding considerable public attention. However, the name “Donald Trump” is mentioned much more times than the name “Barack Obama” which may have been caused by the global situation. While the US-China relations during the Obama presidency were mostly cooperative and peaceful, their relations significantly worsened during the Trump presidency. During Trump's presidency, we can observe the onset of the great power competition and US-China relations became a higher-priority topic for the media.

Their respective US Secretaries of State, Hillary Clinton and Rex Tillerson, also have generally high occurrences in the articles which underscores the critical role that key officials play in shaping and influencing US-China relations. This consistent high profile of Secretaries of State as well as other key officials such as former US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in the articles signifies their integral contribution to diplomatic endeavors and their high impact on the discourse surrounding the U.S.-China relations. 

Chinese president Xi Jinping is mentioned primarily from the year 2013, when he became president of the People's Republic of China. However, his name is mentioned much less than the names of the US presidents which might have been caused by the bias of the New York Times as the american newspaper. 

However, as the data reveals, key Chinese and US political figures are not the only drivers of US-China relations. We can observe several actors from third countries and non-official actors as well. In 2009, one of the most mentioned names was former US president Richard Nixon. This is connected to the effort of the then US president Barack Obama, who endeavored to strengthen relations with China—a diplomatic initiative reminiscent of the endeavors undertaken by Richard Nixon in the 1970s. The media compared Obama's efforts to Nixon's.

We can see two key persons who significantly influenced US-China relations even though they had no political role. One of them is Chen Guangcheng, a civil rights activist persecuted in China, who fled to the US embassy in Beijing. He was a subject of several negotiations between the US and China. The other is Edward Snowden, an American whistleblower, who leaked highly classified information. He fled to Hong Kong where he spent several weeks following his actions.

The data also reveals which countries play a major role in the US-China relations. It is North Korea, India, Japan, Venezuela, Russia (in later years) and Philippines. Their leaders regularly occur among the 5 most mentioned people by year in the corpus.

## Topic modelling
Topic modelling has been realised on both the corpus encompassing all the articles and on each terms' corpus. We have chosen to create 15 topics, since it is a number precise enough to have well-defined topics, but small enough to allow analysis.  
Several topics appeared in all or most of the topic modellings:
- Russia-related security issues
- Finance and economy, mainly USA's
- Climate change
- Iran and nuclear weapons
- Technology and Huawei   

Some people, as Hillary Clinton and Mike Pompeo, were so mentionned that they could even be categorised as a topic themselves.
