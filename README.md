## Topic modelling
Topic modelling has been realised on both the corpus encompassing all the articles and on each terms' corpus. We have chosen to create 15 topics, since it is a number precise enough to have well-defined topics, but small enough to allow analysis.  
Several topics appeared in all or most of the topic modellings:
- Russia-related security issues
- Finance and economy, mainly USA's
- Climate change
- Iran and nuclear weapons
- Technology and Huawei   

Some people, as Hillary Clinton and Mike Pompeo, were so mentionned that they could even be categorised as a topic themselves.
