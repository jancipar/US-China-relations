A ‘Plastic Juncture’ in World Affairs,"AS President Barack Obama enters his second term, the state of the world is unsettled. The leading powers are beset with economic crises or are in various states of political transition or gridlock. The Middle East is undergoing political upheaval. Tensions are rising in Asia. The world’s institutions — whether the United Nations, the Group of 20 or the European Union — are weakened and dysfunctional. The liberal world order established after World War II is fraying at the edges.",2013-01-20 11:27:21+00:00

In the first, people can travel abroad, buy and sell their homes and keep money securely in banks. In the other Russia, President Vladimir Putin stifles dissent, alleges NATO missile defense threats, and seeks to ensnare former Soviet neighbors in an unequal Eurasian union. A new diplomacy that deals effectively with both Russias is essential.",2013-01-24 12:11:25+00:00

How much of that is because she is an outspoken supporter of women’s rights is unclear, but it is almost certainly a factor: China is run by men (literally — there is not a single woman in the inner circle of power, the Standing Committee of the Politburo), and women have little policy input, whether on domestic or global issues.",2013-01-28 06:36:40+00:00

In his early years, Newcomb watched his union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, lose one battle after another in its ongoing struggle with management. In the ’80s and ’90s, workers throughout the country justifiably feared that their plants might close and move to a union-free state. Or that they might simply import products from low-wage, nonunionized countries like Mexico and China. Newcomb told me that at his company, International Specialty Products, workers were disgruntled and the work suffered — for example, more than 20 percent of one chemical they produced didn’t pass inspection.",2013-01-29 10:00:08+00:00

But there is a message in that empty bottle: Little is expected from this trip — not only because little is possible, but because, from a narrow U.S. point of view, little is necessary. Quietly, with nobody announcing it, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has shifted from a necessity to a hobby for American diplomats. Like any hobby — building model airplanes or knitting sweaters — some days you work on it, some days you don’t. It depends on your mood, but it doesn’t usually matter when that sweater gets finished. Obama worked on this hobby early in his first term. He got stuck as both parties rebuffed him, and, therefore, he adopted, quite rationally in my view, an attitude of benign neglect. It was barely noticed.",2013-03-13 01:17:59+00:00

He puts on a bathrobe and pads downstairs to the kitchen, where he turns on his La Pavoni espresso machine with the hand-levered piston that allows him to feel, amid all he can’t control at the Metropolitan Opera, that he can at least control the quality of his coffee. He fixes a skim-milk cappuccino with two shots of espresso, eats a banana and then sits down in his home office, where the walls are decorated with autographed scores by Verdi, Puccini and Shostakovich and the shelves are filled with hundreds of CDs, including some by his great-uncle, the renowned violinist Jascha Heifetz.

A Game of Shark and Minnow,"In a remote corner of the South China Sea, 105 nautical miles from the Philippines, lies a submerged reef that the Filipinos call Ayungin. There’s little to commend the spot, apart from its plentiful fish and safe harbor. In most ways it resembles the hundreds of other desolate reefs, islands, rock clusters and cays that collectively are called the Spratly Islands. But Ayungin is different. It sits on the southwestern edge of Reed Bank, an area rumored to contain vast reserves of oil and natural gas. And its shallows are home to a World War II-era ship called the Sierra Madre, which the Philippine government ran aground on the reef in 1999 and has since maintained as a kind of post-apocalyptic military garrison, manned by eight Filipino troops struggling to survive extreme mental and physical desolation. Of all places, the scorched shell of the Sierra Madre has become an unlikely battleground in a geopolitical struggle that will shape the future of the South China Sea and, to some extent, the rest of the world.",2013-10-24 22:49:09+00:00

Anger Grows in Vietnam Over Dispute With China,"HANOI, Vietnam — Thousands of workers rampaged through an industrial area in southern Vietnam on Tuesday in what reportedly began as protests against China’s stationing of an oil rig in disputed waters off of Vietnam’s coast.  The riots were some of the worst civil unrest in recent years and appear to have prompted  restraints on the local media by Vietnam’s authoritarian government. An article about the protests that was posted online by a Vietnamese state newspaper on Tuesday was removed by Wednesday morning.  The Chinese Embassy in Hanoi issued a notice on Wednesday that urged Chinese living in Vietnam to “minimize unnecessary outings.”  A staff member at the Chutex Garment Factory north of Ho Chi Minh City said 8,000 to 10,000 workers were involved in the rampage at his factory.  “They burned the office,” said the staff member who agreed to speak on condition that his name not be used. The rioters “burned everything, all of the materials, computers, machines.”  Police units and fire fighters arrived at the factory Tuesday and “disbanded,” the rioters, he said. On Wednesday morning police “captured” around 15 to 20 men who were attempting to loot the premises, he said.  The Chutex factory, located in Song Than Industrial Park 2 in southern Binh Duong Province, is described on its web site as one of the largest garment exporters in Vietnam. Chutex International, the parent company, was founded by a Taiwanese garment executive.  It is unclear why rioters targeted a factory linked to Taiwan.

The Brent price has fallen more than a third since June and closed on Friday at $70.15 a barrel. “The inability or unwillingness of OPEC to act showed that the cartel was no longer the dominating producer whose decisions determine global supplies and prices,” Mr. Krauss writes. The balance of power is now shifting to the United States, which is poised to surpass Saudi Arabia as the world’s top producer. ",2014-12-01 12:20:47+00:00

Atomic Dilemma: Debating How to Prevent Iran From Developing Nuclear Weapons,"Overview |  The United States, Israel, Saudi Arabia and other allies agree that Iran must not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon. But beyond that consensus, there is a fundamental split in what is the best way to achieve that goal. Is it diplomacy? Is it punishment, in the form of economic sanctions, and threats, in the form of imminent military action? And even if negotiations yield an agreement, will a country like Iran, with which the United States has had no formal relations since 1979, abide by an agreement, or will it simply use the accord as a cover for producing a breakout weapon? These are tough questions. And the best answer is up for debate — the kind of complex real-world debate students can participate in, write about and learn from in this lesson.

The concept of “one country, two systems” was invented to describe the relationship between Hong Kong and mainland China.
