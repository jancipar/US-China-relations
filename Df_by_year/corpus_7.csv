"In Far-Flung Myanmar, a Land of Contradictions","It is strange how some of the world’s most retrograde authoritarian states end up being such inadvertent conservators of both their country’s architectural heritage and vast tracts of wild, unspoiled nature.

Q. and A.: Matt Ferchen on China and the Price of Oil,"The recent global drop in oil prices has made winners of consumers in places like the United States and Japan, and losers of countries that depend heavily on oil exports such as Russia, Iran and Venezuela. China, a leading crude oil importer and the world’s largest energy consumer, has responded to the fall in oil prices — the steepest since 2009 — by going on a buying spree to ensure that its strategic oil reserves at the end of 2014 were twice what they were the year before. Last month, in another move to bolster the country’s supplies, China’s top economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, directed domestic oil refiners to stock up on crude oil and to provide the government with monthly updates on their inventories.",2015-02-05 04:53:55+00:00

Atomic Dilemma: Debating How to Prevent Iran From Developing Nuclear Weapons,"Overview |  The United States, Israel, Saudi Arabia and other allies agree that Iran must not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon. But beyond that consensus, there is a fundamental split in what is the best way to achieve that goal. Is it diplomacy? Is it punishment, in the form of economic sanctions, and threats, in the form of imminent military action? And even if negotiations yield an agreement, will a country like Iran, with which the United States has had no formal relations since 1979, abide by an agreement, or will it simply use the accord as a cover for producing a breakout weapon? These are tough questions. And the best answer is up for debate — the kind of complex real-world debate students can participate in, write about and learn from in this lesson.
