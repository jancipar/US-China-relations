Gore Restates Climate Case in Senate,"WASHINGTON - Former Vice President Al Gore was back on Capitol Hill on Wednesday with a new set of scary slides dramatizing the heating of the planet and urging lawmakers to act quickly on President Obama's stimulus package, which contains billions of dollars in alternative energy investments.  Mr. Gore, the 2000 Democratic presidential nominee and co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on climate change, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the new spending Mr. Obama is proposing will begin to quickly reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants blamed for global warming.  ""The plan's unprecedented and critical investments in four key areas -– energy efficiency, renewables, a unified national energy smart grid and the move to clean cars –- represent an important down payment and are long overdue,"" Mr. Gore said. ""These crucial investments will create millions of new jobs and hasten our economic recovery, while strengthening our national security and beginning to solve the climate crisis.""  He called the short-term investments a prelude to the larger task of placing a price on carbon to discourage its use as an energy source, either through a direct tax or a cap-and-trade system or both.   In Mr. Gore's last appearance before Congress, in March 2007, his pleas were well-received by some lawmakers and scoffed at by others. The Bush administration largely ignored his warnings of a ""planetary emergency"" and pursued a less urgent approach to climate issues.  But on Wednesday, Mr. Gore served essentially as a cheerleader and lobbyist for Mr. Obama, who has consulted him on environmental and energy issues and named several of his former aides to top policymaking positions. Mr. Gore was gently challenged by some Republican members of the committee who wanted him to endorse nuclear power as a clean alternative to coal and to endorse returning to the public all revenues from a carbon reduction regime.  Mr. Gore and Mr. Obama want Congress to act this year on a cap-and-trade system to control greenhouse gases through a permitting system to demonstrate American seriousness on the issue in advance of talks in Copenhagen in December on a new international climate change treaty.  ""A fair, effective and balanced treaty will put in place the global architecture that will place the world –- at long last and in the nick of time – on a path toward solving the climate crisis and securing the future of human civilization,"" Mr. Gore told the panel.  For those who want more detail, here's the prepared text of Mr. Gore's testimony:     Statement to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee As Prepared Hon. Al Gore Wednesday, January 28, 2009  We are here today to talk about how we as Americans and how the United States of America as part of the global community should address the dangerous and growing threat of the climate crisis. We have arrived at a moment of decision. Our home – Earth – is in grave danger. What is at risk of being destroyed is not the planet itself, of course, but the conditions that have made it hospitable for human beings.  Moreover, we must face up to this urgent and unprecedented threat to the existence of our civilization at a time when our country must simultaneously solve two other worsening crises. Our economy is in its deepest recession since the 1930s. And our national security is endangered by a vicious terrorist network and the complex challenge of ending the war in Iraq honorably while winning the military and political struggle in Afghanistan. As we search for solutions to all three of these challenges, it is becoming clearer that they are linked by a common thread – our dangerous over-reliance on carbon-based fuels.  As long as we continue to send hundreds of billions of dollars for foreign oil – year after year – to the most dangerous and unstable regions of the world, our national security will continue to be at risk.  As long as we continue to allow our economy to remain shackled to the OPEC rollercoaster of rising and falling oil prices, our jobs and our way of life will remain at risk. Moreover, as the demand for oil worldwide grows rapidly over the longer term, even as the rate of new discoveries is falling, it is increasingly obvious that the roller coaster is headed for a crash. And we're in the front car.  Most importantly, as long as we continue to depend on dirty fossil fuels like coal and oil to meet our energy needs, and dump 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the thin shell of atmosphere surrounding our planet, we move closer and closer to several dangerous tipping points which scientists have repeatedly warned – again just yesterday – will threaten to make it impossible for us to avoid irretrievable destruction of the conditions that make human civilization possible on this planet. We're borrowing money from China to buy oil from the Persian Gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet. Every bit of that's got to change.  For years our efforts to address the growing climate crisis have been undermined by the idea that we must choose between our planet and our way of life; between our moral duty and our economic well being. These are false choices. In fact, the solutions to the climate crisis are the very same solutions that will address our economic and national security crises as well.  In order to repower our economy, restore American economic and moral leadership in the world and regain control of our destiny, we must take bold action now.  The first step is already before us. I urge this Congress to quickly pass the entirety of President Obama's Recovery package. The plan's unprecedented and critical investments in four key areas – energy efficiency, renewables, a unified national energy grid and the move to clean cars – represent an important down payment and are long overdue. These crucial investments will create millions of new jobs and hasten our economic recovery – while strengthening our national security and beginning to solve the climate crisis.  Quickly building our capacity to generate clean electricity will lay the groundwork for the next major step needed: placing a price on carbon. If Congress acts right away to pass President Obama's Recovery package and then takes decisive action this year to institute a cap-and-trade system for CO2 emissions – as many of our states and many other countries have already done – the United States will regain its credibility and enter the Copenhagen treaty talks with a renewed authority to lead the world in shaping a fair and effective treaty. And this treaty must be negotiated this year. Not next year. This year.  A fair, effective and balanced treaty will put in place the global architecture that will place the world – at long last and in the nick of time – on a path toward solving the climate crisis and securing the future of human civilization. I am hopeful that this can be achieved. Let me outline for you the basis for the hope and optimism that I feel.  The Obama Administration has already signaled a strong willingness to regain U.S. leadership on the global stage in the treaty talks, reversing years of inaction. This is critical to success in Copenhagen and is clearly a top priority of the administration.  Developing countries that were once reluctant to join in the first phases of a global response to the climate crisis have themselves now become leaders in demanding action and in taking bold steps on their own initiatives. Brazil has proposed an impressive new plan to halt the destructive deforestation in that nation. Indonesia has emerged as a new constructive force in the talks. And China's leaders have gained a strong understanding of the need for action and have already begun important new initiatives. Heads of state from around the world have begun to personally engage on this issue and forward-thinking corporate leaders have made this a top priority.  More and more Americans are paying attention to the new evidence and fresh warnings from scientists. There is a much broader consensus on the need for action than there was when President George H.W. Bush negotiated – and the Senate ratified – the Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992 and much stronger support for action than when we completed the Kyoto Protocol in 1997.  The elements that I believe are key to a successful agreement in Copenhagen include: • Strong targets and timetables from industrialized countries and differentiated but binding commitments from developing countries that put the entire world under a system with one commitment: to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other global warming pollutants that cause the climate crisis; • The inclusion of deforestation, which alone accounts for twenty percent of the emissions that cause global warming; • The addition of sinks including those from soils, principally from farmlands and grazing lands with appropriate methodologies and accounting. Farmers and ranchers in the U.S. and around the world need to know that they can be part of the solution; • The assurance that developing countries will have access to mechanisms and resources that will help them adapt to the worst impacts of the climate crisis and technologies to solve the problem; and, • A strong compliance and verification regime.  The road to Copenhagen is not easy, but we have traversed this ground before. We have negotiated the Montreal Protocol, a treaty to protect the ozone layer, and strengthened it to the point where we have banned most of the major substances that create the ozone hole over Antarctica. And we did it with bipartisan support. President Ronald Reagan and Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill joined hands to lead the way.  Let me now briefly discuss in more detail why we must do all of this within the next year, and with your permission Mr. Chairman, I would like to show a few new pictures that illustrate the unprecedented need for bold and speedy action this year.  Thank you Mr. Chairman. I am eager to respond to any questions that you and the members of the committee have.   ",2009-01-28 19:17:54+00:00

That 'Buy American' Provision,"(Photo: (Photo: Maurizio Gambarini/European Pressphoto Agency))   ""Buy American"" is a familiar cry in Washington, even though the vast majority of American economists and policy makers oppose anything that hints at protectionism. President Obama has said that ""we can't send a protectionist message,"" and the Senate softened a buy-American provision in the stimulus bill it passed by stipulating that any government procurement policies comply with World Trade Organization rules. But business interests argued that the language favoring American producers should have been removed altogether.   Why is the buy-American idea objectionable, or, alternatively, under what circumstances should it be promoted?      Robert E. Scott, Economic Policy Institute Jagdish Bhagwati, professor of economics and law Roger Simmermaker, author and local union official  Burton Folsom Jr., historian  Ha-Joon Chang, an economist Gary Clyde Hufbauer, Peterson Institute for International Economics Sherrod Brown, Democratic senator  Anne Krueger, professor of international economics     What Trade Treaty Violation?  Robert E. Scott is the senior international economist at the Economic Policy Institute.  The buy-American rule in the stimulus bill is smart policy that won't run afoul of any of our trade treaties.  When the government buys steel for a bridge, for example, it has several objectives. Minimizing costs is one, but when the economy is in recession, there is added incentive to stimulate domestic employment. And when steel is purchased from a domestic producer the workers' wages generate further spending, which supports yet more jobs in the domestic economy.   When domestic industries have been injured by unfair trade practices, protecting them is good policy.Although the United States and 38 other countries have signed World Trade Organization procurement codes prohibiting restrictions on government purchases between member countries, the act does not violate these commitments. Indeed, the House version of the act implicitly exempts these countries from the buy-American clause, and the Senate version does so explicitly.   Some of the loudest protests about buy-American provisions have come from self-interested American companies like Caterpillar and General Electric that manufacture overseas. Foreign ministers from China and Russia, which haven't signed the procurement codes, have also complained, but these countries simply want something for nothing. Giving them access to stimulus spending will dilute the impact of the recovery bill and eliminate all incentives for them to sign the codes.  When domestic industries have been injured by unfair trade practices, protecting them is good policy. For example, China spent more than $15 billion on energy subsidies for its steel industry in 2007 alone. These subsidies were illegal under World Trade Organization rules, and the United States has an obligation to protect domestic steel producers in such cases.     A Retaliatory Spiral Jagdish Bhagwati, a professor of economics and law at Columbia and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, is the author, most recently, of ""Termites in the Trading System.""  Despite protectionism rearing its ugly head from time to time during the campaign, Barack Obama has been mostly silent on trade issues. This was a disappointment for many of us who are supporters of free trade. We were reassured when he finally argued — and the Senate agreed — that the buy-America provisions in the stimulus package bill must be consistent with World Trade Organization rules. But more needs to be said, and done.  First, having the buy-America provisions stay in, even with the W.T.O.-consistency qualifier, is much less satisfactory than what Senator John McCain suggested, which was to take them out altogether. The truth is that lobbyists can spend vast amounts of money challenging the qualifier, leaving protectionism alive and well.   The buy-American provisions unravel previous trade agreements unilaterally and in violation to the concessions we made.Second, the notion that even an effective W.T.O.-consistency qualifier in our procurements will soothe other nations and prevent trade retaliations and trade wars is naïve. Contrary to what others believe, countries like Brazil, China and India, which have not signed the W.T.O.'s 1995 agreement on governmental procurement and, therefore, do not enjoy those rights to our procurement purchases, will retaliate. They can raise many current tariffs also in a ""W.T.O.-consistent"" way. (Remember that China and India have large public sectors.) They can easily shift their purchases of aircraft, nuclear reactors and other high-value goods from us to Europe and Japan. We would then retaliate, prompting retaliations by the others: all in a W.T.O.-consistent fashion. Indeed, President Obama would find himself in a W.T.O.-consistent trade war.  The A.F.L.-C.I.O. argues that the Europeans, for their part, protect certain domestic sectors in their government procurement decisions, so it is O.K. for us to close their access to our procurement via buy-American provisions. But this is a mistaken argument.  The W.T.O.'s agreement on government procurement allows signatories to choose the sectors to which they will apply it. So, we have chosen our sectors where the others can bid for our contracts just as the European Union has chosen their sectors where we can bid. These choices, and therefore exclusions of other sectors, are part of the overall balance of concessions that were reached in several areas like agriculture, services and manufactures. To argue that we are now free to terminate access to our procurement in areas we previously agreed to open to bids from the Europeans is to unravel that bargain unilaterally and in violation to the concessions we made.   With the bailout to Detroit straining the 1995 W.T.O. agreement on subsidy and countervailing measures and inviting a spread of mutually harmful subsidies worldwide, and with the demands for ""fair trade"" also being assiduously pressed on him by the unions lobbies wrongly fearful of external competition, President Obama faces several protectionist challenges. It is time now for him to make one of his resounding speeches, this time on the virtues of free trade and the perils of protectionism.     Buy American, While We Can Roger Simmermaker, an electronics technician for a large defense contractor and the vice president of his local machinists union, is the author of ""How Americans Can Buy American.""   It's simply not necessary to buy the steel, iron and other manufactured materials we need to build and repair our roads and bridges from other countries when we can supply it ourselves.  The buy-American provision in the economic stimulus bill isn't as much about a return to protectionism as it is about a return to the American virtues and values — self-sufficiency, self-reliance and independence — that this country was founded on.  There's nothing wrong with achieving a balance of trade if we have to restrict imports to do it.Workers in foreign countries don't pay taxes to America. Only American workers pay taxes to America. We need to employ American steelworkers, ironworkers and autoworkers so we need to not only keep and create American jobs, but we also need to keep our huge and growing national debt from getting hopelessly out of control.  When we borrow money from China to pay for the stimulus bill, we'll be borrowing — and paying interest on — money that used to be ours before we sent it there in the belief that free trade and cheap foreign imports were the answers to a prosperous economy.   At best, the buy-American provision of the stimulus bill will help balance world trade. As Americans, we seek balance in virtually every aspect of our lives. We strive to balance our work life and our family life. We strive to balance our commitments to our communities and our commitments at home. There's nothing wrong with achieving a balance of trade if we have to restrict imports to do it.  The answer to America's economic problems is right in our own backyard: buy American while there is still American left to buy.    Disaster Lesson From the 1930s Burton Folsom Jr., a professor of history and management at Hillsdale College and a senior historian at the Foundation for Economic Education, is the author of the ""Myth of the Robber Barons"" and ""New Deal or Raw Deal?""   ""Slap a tariff on China and save American jobs,"" the protectionists say.  The collapsing export market after 1930 helped to set off a decline in American industry. This tempting line of reasoning is flawed for two reasons. First, if Americans pay more for, say, American-made shoes or shirts, then they have less to spend for other things they might need — they are simply subsidizing inefficient local producers. And those American manufacturers, who are protected from foreign competitors, have little incentive to innovate and cut prices.   Second, if we refuse to buy China's imports, China will refuse to buy our exports, including our first-rate computers and iPods. Our export market collapses. We saw this happen during the Great Depression when Congress passed, and President Herbert Hoover signed, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff in 1930. That tariff, the highest in United States history, foisted high import duties on more than 3,000 foreign items. The Europeans immediately retaliated, and this deepened the Depression throughout the world. When we refused to buy Swiss watches, for example, the Swiss refused to buy American wheat and Chevrolets.   The collapsing export market after 1930 helped to set off a decline in American industry. United States automakers sold more than five million cars and trucks in 1929, but only about 1.8 million in 1933. Other causes (including tax increases under both Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt) also made the Great Depression worse, but the Smoot-Hawley Tariff was a significant reason the Depression was as severe as it was — 25 percent unemployment at its worst.   Free trade benefits buyers and sellers. Tariffs benefit certain sellers at the expense of all buyers.    Necessary Breathing Space Ha-Joon Chang, an economist at the University of Cambridge, is the author of ""Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism.""  Is protectionism good or bad? The short answer is that it depends.  There are two kinds of protectionism. One is the protectionism that developing countries need to protect and nurture new producers. It is known as infant-industry protection and is based on the same reasoning that people use when they send their children to school, rather than making them child laborers. It can fail but it was successfully used by virtually all of today's rich countries when they were developing countries themselves -- starting from 18th century Britain, through 19th century United States and Sweden, to 20th century Japan and Korea.   We need a new international trade agreement that allows for transparent, forward-looking and time-bound protectionism.The other is a kind of protectionism that all countries, both mature and developing, sometimes need when they must make sudden large adjustments. Unlike finance, where things can be rearranged quickly, the real economy takes time to adjust. Therefore, when you have a big shock like today's economic crisis, it makes sense to create the breathing space for the producers to restructure. This is why, even as they are repeating their commitments to free trade, the rich countries are providing their industries a huge amount of direct and indirect protection.  Some people worry that this will lead to a 1930s-style all-out trade war. But in the short run, there is actually no danger of that. Now we have the World Trade Organization, the European Union and many other regional trade agreements that limit protectionism. Of course, in the longer run, if veiled protectionism continues, we run the risk of making a mockery of these agreements and destroying the global trading system.  However, the solution to this problem should not be an adherence to the principle of free trade, which is not workable in practice anyway, but instead to establish a new international agreement that allows a transparent, forward-looking and time-bound protectionism as well as more infant-industry protection for developing countries. In other words, by allowing more protectionism now in a controlled way, we will be able to preserve the international trading system better in the longer run.    Trade Wars Kill Jobs Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, is the co-author of a recent policy brief on the buy-American proposal.  The buy-American proposal in the stimulus package makes no sense — not for United States employment, and certainly not for spurring recovery from the world's worst downturn since the Great Depression.   The positive impact of the provision would be trivial: fewer than 9,000 American jobs and only a few billion dollars of American imports.The positive impact of the provision drafted in the Senate bill in terms of jobs and trade would be trivial: fewer than 9,000 American jobs and only a few billion dollars of American imports. But the negative impact — coming as it does from the United States — would be a disaster. Essentially this measure says to the world: ""Go ahead and put on new protection, just so long as you obey the letter of your commitments in the World Trade Organization.""   Other countries have plenty of room, within their legal commitments, to raise tariffs on imports from the United States or in less visible ways to punish leading American exporters, like FedEx, Microsoft, TimeWarner, United Technologies, Boeing, Caterpillar and General Electric. Indeed, in a tit-for-tat trade war, the United States could easily lose far more than 9,000 American jobs. The fact that France is asking its auto firms to cut down production in the Czech Republic, or that British banks are pulling money out of South America does not mean the United States should follow them down the protectionist path. It's not our habit to imitate the worst behavior of Europe or anyplace else.   Supporters of the buy-American provision correctly state that other countries already impose higher barriers on their industrial imports than the United States does -- that's certainly true for Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia and South Africa. But world recovery will be long delayed if countries decide that ""leveling up"" to the highest barriers is the right way to go.     Help U.S. Manufacturing Sherrod Brown is a Democratic senator from Ohio.  As Congress debated the economy recovery package, it became clear that the American people have been willing to reach deep into their pockets and spend tens of billions of dollars to build roads, repair bridges and construct water and sewer systems. And all that they want is that the work be done by Americans and that the materials they use are made in America.  Who could be against that? Well, some Ivy League economists don't like it — something about Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression. And newspaper publishers pontificate about free trade theory, as they see their advertisers flee and their papers shrink. And the corporate executives of some of America's largest corporations tell us it will cause a trade war, as they collect million-dollar bonuses while laying off American workers and outsourcing jobs to China and India.  These are not people who are about to lose their jobs to bad trade policy. Other than this small, shall we say elite group, you could search far and wide and find almost no one who thinks ""Made in America"" is a bad idea.  Yet when some of us in the Senate proposed strengthening the buy-America laws, and enforcing the buy-America rules, that have been around for decades, some economists, newspaper publishers and business executives accused us of being -- gasp -- protectionists.  An $800 billion trade deficit and they accuse the United States of protectionism? Two-billion-dollars-a-day net outflow of trade dollars and they claim we are closing our borders? In Ohio, people would say that accusations like that don't pass the straight face test.  The purpose of buy-America laws is to promote United States manufacturing and encourage new industry -- both of which come in handy when a country is trying to put its economy on the right track, maintain global economic leadership and create jobs for the millions of American standing in unemployment lines.  Let's be clear. Buy America does not mandate the purchase of United States goods. Buy America allows waivers in cases where American-made products necessary for a project are not readily available. Waivers are also allowed where total project cost is 25 percent more expensive than it would be if imports were used. The buy-America provision in the economic recovery package maintains this flexibility.   It does not violate World Trade Organization agreements or any international trade laws. It encourages the use of taxpayer dollars to invest in American companies and create jobs. Buy America is a choice. Do we want to use billions in tax dollars to create jobs in Ohio or in China?   While our European and Asian competition too often subsidizes their industries, protects their businesses and fights for their workers, our manufacturers continue to decline. And our government gives companies tax breaks when they outsource jobs. Countries around the world practice trade according to their national interest. Perhaps the United States should do the same.    Damages Outweigh Gains Anne Krueger, a former first deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund, is a professor of international economics at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.  The damage to employment would surely outweigh any gains. This is even more true now than it was in earlier years as industries throughout the world have sought supplies of their parts and components from the cheapest source.   Once protectionist measures are adopted, they are difficult to remove.The buy-American measure in the stimulus package would do little, in part because few imports are used in construction projects. But the signal that it would send to other countries would invite protective measures to the detriment of American exports and employment.  Once protectionist measures are adopted, they are difficult to remove. In the long run, choking off through protection the integration of the world economy reduces productivity and prospects for future growth of all economies. It does not make any sense to sacrifice longer term growth prospects for measures that, even in the short run, offer very little prospect except for the very few at the cost of many others.

What the Chinese Want From Obama,"(Photo: (Photo: Oliver Weiken/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images) Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with President Hu Jintao in the Great Hall of People, Beijing.)   As she meets with Chinese leaders this weekend, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is expected to begin a more vigorous engagement with China on issues ranging from climate change to the global financial crisis.   We asked these experts, all of whom are based in China, what people there expect from the Obama administration and what issues they think should be on Mrs. Clinton's agenda.      Daniel A. Bell, professor at Tsinghua University Andy Xie, economist Zhang Haibin, professor at Peking University Michael Meyer, author and hutong expert    Chinese Skepticism Daniel A. Bell is professor of political theory at Tsinghua University in Beijing. He is the author of ""China's New Confucianism: Politics and Everyday Life in a Changing Society.""   Hillary Clinton visits China at a time when fewer young people are looking West for political ideals, when American-style capitalism is typically blamed for the global financial crisis, and when foreign firms have lost their shine. This attitude shift means that building a more mature U.S.-China relationship and broaching issues like global warming and human rights will require even deeper engagement.    (Click to enlarge.) ""The Audacity of Hope"" on display in Beijing, where students seem immune to 'Obama mania.' (Photo: Frederic J. Brown/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images)Most of my students seem surprisingly immune to Obama mania. That may be because relations between China and the United States have been steady since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, largely because the Bush administration turned its attention away from China and toward other perceived threats.   Of course, there is respect for Mr. Obama's intellectual abilities and leadership skills. But even ""liberal"" students are given to skepticism. One of my graduate students told me that she was dismayed by the uncritical coverage of the inauguration, the kind of love-fest for a political leader that could only make the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party envious. We discussed, only half-jokingly, the possibility that China should adopt some form of constitutional monarchy, so that the public could project its emotions on a symbolic leader while evaluating the de facto political leader's performance more rationally.   For now, debate over political structures has taken a back seat to worries about the financial meltdown. China's export-based economy has been hit hard, though there's optimism that domestic consumers will lead the recovery. Today, the most competitive jobs are in the public sector, with tens of thousands of students competing for jobs in the civil service that offer more security.  Most students recognize that change must come, but democracy is now more often blamed for political instability and economic inefficiency. Hence, they and many intellectuals are turning to China's own traditions for inspiration. Democracy with Chinese characteristics is still the slogan, with more debates centering on the Chinese characteristics.   The Obama administration could better connect with these groups, which have influence on political change, by showing a genuine interest in China's culture, allowing for the possibility of morally justifiable difference and treating China as an equal with something positive to offer. At this moment, even symbolic gestures -- perhaps using a few words of Chinese in speeches addressing them -- could help in that direction.    Two Economies, Inseparable Andy Xie, formerly of the World Bank, is an economist based in Shanghai.  It's never been more true that Americans and the Chinese are joined at the hip, at least economically. And nothing demonstrates that more clearly than the current financial crisis — which may make the U.S.-China relationship more of a partnership and also more fraught with new kinds of tensions.   What happens in Florida and Arizona can have a significant and immediate effect on jobs in Guangdong. For example, when 70 percent of the furniture sold in the United States is made in China, any downturn in the housing market (fewer buyers of new furniture) means layoffs in China. The United States lost three million jobs since the subprime-mortgage debacle. China has lost 20 million.  Many Chinese are now very uneasy about the country's huge holdings of United States treasuries and agency bonds. More than five million Chinese college students are graduating, and they will compete for jobs against five million college graduates from previous years who haven't found jobs. Ten million unemployed college graduates pose a big stability issue for the Chinese government. That is a situation that can push a country into a more aggressive posture, sometimes toward trading partners. Though, so far, the Chinese leadership has taken more conciliatory stance toward the United States than popular opinion demands.  On the finance side, the United States is now the largest foreign investor in China. And China is the largest owner of the U.S. treasury bonds. Some estimates put China 's holdings of the U.S. debt papers at $1.7 trillion. Since President Obama's $783 billion fiscal stimulus will be financed by issuing more treasuries, there's no doubt China's continued buying of the bonds will be essential.   But many Chinese are becoming very uneasy about the country's huge holdings of United States treasuries and agency bonds. America has gotten into the current trouble from living beyond its means — borrowing to maintain a lifestyle it cannot afford.   The Obama policies don't address this problem. In fact, the stimulus replaces household borrowing with government borrowing, with ever more debt owed to foreigners. China's position as the largest creditor adds to the concern here about the dollar's value and how well the U.S. is managing the financial crisis.   Lastly, the valuation of the yuan could remain a divisive issue for the two nations. In fact, the yuan's value should be allowed to float in the future. But to insist on that now would be dangerous with the dollar's stability dependent on its linkage to yuan. If China is pressured to float the yuan, the dollar's value could fall, causing an inflationary surge in the United States. We need to work out a long-term plan for floating the yuan, but not use megaphone diplomacy to harangue China into doing something that could hurt everyone now.    How to Make Progress on Climate Issues Zhang Haibin is an associate professor at the School of International Studies, Peking University, and a member of the Expert Team on Trade and Environment, Chinese Ministry of Commerce.   It's unrealistic to expect a great leap in climate cooperation between China and the United States, given the complexity of the issue and the lack of mutual trust. Still, there are good signs that meaningful progress can be made with the Obama administration.    (Click to enlarge.) Factory in Tianjin. (Photo: Reuters)As the world's two biggest energy consumers and emitters of greenhouse gases, both nations have to find ways to create low-carbon economies. China is potentially a huge market for clean energy technology, and the United States has advanced energy technology and rich resources. Cooperation on this issue could actually lead to better economic and trade relations.   Three factors, however, have stood in the way, even though the two nations have signed almost 40 bilateral energy and environmental agreements in the last three decades. Until now, there's been reluctance on the part of the United States to make climate change a real priority in bilateral relations with China. (The European Union and Japan both released joint statements with China on climate change, demonstrating their intention to work together.)  The U.S. should set an example on greenhouse gas limits that China can follow. Hostility toward Communism excludes China from receiving official development aid from the United States, which could significantly hasten climate-change-related projects. Such aid remains a main channel for North-South cooperation on climate change, and without it China-U.S. efforts have been crippled. (Japan and the European Union both provide aid to China for climate-change projects.)   Perhaps the greatest hurdle has been the disagreement over which nations should take the lead in curbing greenhouse gas emissions. The United States required developing nations, China and India in particular, to reduce emissions in step with developed countries; China rejected any binding mitigation commitment.   The Obama administration could end this impasse by signing a summit document on climate change with China, helping China invest in climate-change projects by providing development assistance, and setting an example by accepting binding emissions targets.  In response, China will need to show that it can meet the ambitious energy conservation and emissions mitigation targets in its 11th Five-Year Plan. It should set firm targets beyond 2010, and be open to a discussion of when China will join the developed countries in accepting binding targets.  Nobody knows exactly how far and fast the two nations can go in addressing climate change. But it's clear that cooperation on this issue will, to a great extent, define their future relations.    China's American Way of Life  Michael Meyer is the author of ""The Last Days of Old Beijing: Life in the Vanishing Backstreets of a City Transformed.""  If Hillary Clinton were to step away from photo-ops at the Great Hall of the People and walk 200 yards south past the edge of Tiananmen Square, she would enter Dazhalan — a half-square mile of 114 hutong, or lanes. Home to 57,000 people, this 800-year-old neighborhood exemplifies the sort of urban planning that many American cities seek to recreate, featuring narrow, car-free streets enlivened by a tight-knit community. Mrs. Clinton should visit the area while it's still there; wide roads are slated to pierce through the heart of this historical center, where a new boutique mall and a Wal-Mart already shadow its edges.    (Click to enlarge.) One of the Beijing alleyway neighborhoods known as hutong. (Photo: Shiho Fukada for The New York Times)To rationalize their destruction, city officials call these neighborhoods slums. They are not. As blighted as their single-story courtyard homes may be — most lack central heat and toilets — the hutong do not cause pathologies, but instead foster the type of civic life absent in Beijing's high-rise apartments, partitioned by security guards, fences, multilock doors and a lack of public space.   While no one should have to live in poverty, no matter how picturesque, the lanes' melting pot of natives and migrants, laborers and entrepreneurs, old and young, form a safe, diverse community that would be familiar to Mrs. Clinton, author of a text praising the social model of a village. In Beijing, she might note, it takes a hutong to raise a child.   While fewer than one-eighth of the capital's lanes survive, it may seem beyond our top diplomat's authority to lobby for their preservation. Certainly, Mrs. Clinton's Chinese counterpart could counter with some choice observations of Washington. (Prince Charles, who has never visited Beijing, recently launched a project with a Chinese university to modernize the lanes' housing.)   Yet as modernizing Chinese cities emulate America's car-friendly designs — and often employ American architects, but not clean-energy firms to realize it — she could tie China's urbanization into her broader agenda of engaging Beijing in a partnership to reduce emissions and increase energy efficiency, measures that would affect global health and the economy.   ""If Chinese want to live the American way of life, then we need seven earths to support them,"" the founder of China's first environmental nongovernmental organization once told me. That impact is of less concern to a government funding large-scale urbanization in the service of economic growth. Planners and officials here often insist, with rightful indignation, that ""we have every right to make the same development mistakes that America did.""  Mrs. Clinton could correct that perception with a visit to the hutong the way her husband galvanized AIDS awareness when he hugged an H.I.V.-positive girl at a Beijing speech in 2003. Photos of that encounter still circulate, and AIDS prevention is one of the few positive issues that link Sino-American exchanges. Smart growth could be another. By placing the same importance on development as the countries apply to trade and security, China can learn from the United States' planning mistakes, while also showcasing its huge investment in national infrastructure — airport expansions, bridge-building, high-speed rail projects.   When I first arrived in China as a Peace Corps volunteer in 1995, an American diplomat counseled, ""Forget democracy. You're here to create future Pepsi drinkers."" So here's a suggestion in turn: Mrs. Clinton, forgo a tour of Beijing's restored palaces and impressive Olympic venues. Instead, take a short walk down to Dazhalan's narrow lanes, and as the flashbulbs pop, simply say, ""This is the type of neighborhood I wish America had more of."" If she's thirsty, Wal-Mart's wide aisles are crowded with Pepsi.  ",2009-02-20 13:00:34+00:00

And now, even as Obama and his foreign-policy team edge away from the language of democracy promotion, which they fear that the Freedom Agenda has rendered toxic, Bush has begun to shape what he has called the Freedom Institute, a policy center to be housed alongside his presidential library and museum on the campus of Southern Methodist University.

"After Detention, Where Can the Uighurs Go?","(Photo: (Photo: Karen Bleier/Agence France-Presse - Getty Images) In February, demonstrators in Washington protested the detention of the Uighurs in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.)   As the Obama administration reviews detainee files in its move to close the Guantánamo Bay detention facility, the case of 17 Chinese Muslim Uighurs, who have been held there for seven years without charges, remains a big stumbling block.  The Uighurs were cleared for release in 2004, and in 2008, the Bush administration conceded they were no longer ""enemy combatants."" But they cannot be sent back to China, where they may be tortured, and no other nation has agreed to take them.   The Obama administration is now under pressure to show its willingness to take some detainees into the United States as it tries to persuade other countries to do the same. But such a move is likely to be opposed by military groups and communities where the Uighurs would be resettled.   Given the thorny legal and political problems, what lessons might be learned from the Uighur case?      Jenny Martinez, Stanford law professor Andrew McCarthy, senior fellow, National Review Institute Glenn Sulmasy, law professor at U.S. Coast Guard Academy Diane Marie Amann, law professor at University of California, Davis Deborah Colson, Human Rights First      The Mess Left Behind Jenny S. Martinez, a professor of law at Stanford University, argued the 2004 case of Rumsfeld v. Padilla before the United States Supreme Court.   The case shows how hard it will be for the Obama team to clean up the mess left by the previous administration. Last fall, while the State Department tried to persuade other countries to accept the Uighurs, the Justice Department filed briefs in federal court saying they were too dangerous to be released into the United States.  Dealing sensibly with detainees requires cooperation, within the branches of our own government and with other nations. This was yet another example of the Bush administration's Justice Department failing to consider the advice of lawyers in the State Department and the uniformed military in setting interrogation and detention policies. Of course, it also refused to acknowledge the role of Congress and the courts in setting and reviewing policy.   More than that, the case of the Uighurs demonstrates the degree to which the Bush administration underestimated the impact of its detention policies on our relations with other nations. These detainees cannot be returned to China because they would likely face torture or other mistreatment. At the same time, China considers Uighur separatist groups to be terrorists and so is pressuring other countries not to accept the prisoners. Meanwhile, the European Union's counterterrorism coordinator, Gilles de Kerchove, has reportedly told the United States that it will be difficult to get European countries to accept Guantánamo detainees unless it shows good faith by letting the Uighurs resettle in the United States.   The Uighur case shows that dealing sensibly with detainees requires coordination and cooperation: within the branches of our own government, and with other nations. In today's world, you can't just go it alone.     A Case Built on Irrationality Andrew C. McCarthy, Senior Fellow, National Review Institute, is author of ""Willful Blindness: Memoir of the Jihad.""  The Uighur saga nicely captures all the irrationality and hypocrisy of our counterterrorism approach. That policy foolishly holds that we can focus on terrorist activity without focusing on the jihadist ideology that motivates it.   So what happens? The military, which has released many terrorist operatives in the course of the past several years, saw the Uighurs as a group that could be unloaded. It took the position that they were ""enemy combatants"" but not America's enemy, reasoning that these detainees' dispute was with China. This contention was legally incoherent: one must be America's enemy to be detained by the U.S. as an enemy combatant. It also showed a deep ignorance of jihadist ideology. Relocating them in the U.S. would be irresponsible and fly in the face of the law.  In fact, the Uighurs were captured by coalition forces after the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. Their presence there was not an accident: They had sought and received instruction in the paramilitary camps of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, an al-Qaeda affiliate formally designated as a terrorist organization under U.S. law. Besides their training, at least some of the Uighurs are known to have fought against Coalition forces, and to have joined other terrorist detainees in protests at Guantánamo Bay.   Obviously, because the military's position was untenable, it was appropriate for the reviewing federal appeals court to invalidate the enemy combatant designation - something Congress gave the court the power to do. But the judiciary did not have the power to order the Uighurs released, much less released into the U.S.   In fact, the federal REAL ID Act of 2005 provides for the exclusion of any alien who has received terrorist training or has belonged to an organization that promotes terrorism - against anyone. The Uighurs are excludable on both grounds, even if one accepts, for argument's sake, that they were trained for the purpose of conducting operations against China.  Now, for the purpose of resettling this group, Mr. Obama may ignore statutory provisions - measures enacted precisely because paramilitary training has been a feature of virtually all attacks carried out by radical Islam against the U.S.  Clearly, we cannot send the Uighurs to China; our treaty obligations forbid transfer to countries where detainees are likely to be persecuted. Consequently, they should be detained until another country willing to receive them can be found. Relocating them in the U.S. would be irresponsible and fly in the face of the law.      Prevent Similar Legal Mistakes Glenn Sulmasy is on the law faculty of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. He is the author of a forthcoming book, ""The National Security Court System: A Natural Evolution of Justice in an Age of Terror."" The views expressed here are his own.  The case highlights the many legal and policy ambiguities associated with the ""war on terror."" It also underscores the need for the political branches to work together to establish a clear process for captured fighters to be detained, questioned, and to have their cases adjudicated.  We need to determine the status of alleged enemy combatants soon after they enter custody -- not years later.  The Uighurs were not actually fighting the U. S. when they were captured in Afghanistan; their goal was to attack the Chinese. But now they are our problem. They cannot be released to the Chinese, yet the political consequences of allowing them to settle in the United States does not seem palatable to many.   The United States does have a duty to the Uighurs since they have been in captivity for seven years without charge and without trial. Eventually, they will have to be resettled. We should probably take two lessons from the case. The ""war on terror"" should be refocused as a ""war on al Qaeda"" - the broader approach makes less sense now than perhaps it did immediately after 9/11. We need a new, uniform procedure to ensure that the status of alleged enemy combatants be properly determined soon after they enter custody.   This sort of mistake, if it is to happen again in the future, needs to be recognized quickly through an acceptable habeas process and remedied as soon as possible. The heart of the Uighur problem is that it took seven years to decide what to do.      The Way Out: Grant Asylum Diane Marie Amann is a law professor at University of California, Davis.   The Uighur case is a cautionary tale for this administration as it moves to end abuses in post-9/11 counterterrorism policy.  Recognition that a state can get it wrong - can put the wrong person in jail - is the core reason that our laws require review of the lawfulness of detention. The requirement is found in the habeas corpus clause of the U.S. Constitution, in the Geneva Conventions to which the United States is a full party, and in U.S. criminal statutes and military regulations that implement those guarantees.  The past administration's refusal to comply with this body of law delayed for years the finding that the Uighurs are not enemy combatants, and no doubt complicated the question of what to do with them now. These men cannot expect safety back home in China. No other country has welcomed them. It is time for the United States to do just that - to grant the Uighurs asylum within U.S. borders. We should learn that this result is a foreseeable consequence of denying such persons their rights under the law.    Send a Message, Release Them Deborah Colson is the acting director of the Law & Security Program at Human Rights First.  The Uighurs do not pose a security threat to the United States. Why, then, do they continue to languish in detention?   The Convention against Torture prohibits sending the Uighurs back to their native China, where they are at risk of arrest, torture, or even execution. Diplomatic efforts to resettle the Uighurs in a third country have not been successful in part because of early pronouncements by the Bush administration that all Guantánamo prisoners were dangerous terrorists. Despite the presence of Uighur communities in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and New York that have agreed to provide resettlement assistance, the Bush administration denied them entry into the United States.  The Uighurs petitioned their case to federal court, and in October 2008, a federal district court judge ordered their release. But in a disappointing ruling in February, the appellate court reversed the lower court decision. The circuit court acknowledged the government's inability to put forth any evidence of the Uighers' involvement with al Qaeda or the Taliban, but nonetheless concluded that the district judge had no independent power to require their release.  That ruling does not end the Uighurs' case, nor does it preclude the possibility of resettling them on American soil. It simply underscores the urgent need for President Obama to act to do it himself.  President Obama is unlikely to succeed in closing Guantánamo without the cooperation of other countries. And that cooperation depends on a demonstrated willingness to reject flawed Bush administration policies and chart a new course. Resettling the Uighurs in the United States would send that message, and is central to getting other countries to accept some Guantánamo prisoners themselves.      ",2009-04-01 00:23:12+00:00

Nixon Goes to Europe (Part I),"Unlike Barack Obama, Richard Nixon had planned a presidential trip to Europe even before he won the White House. Coming shortly after his inauguration, the tour was to be part of proving him ""a master statesman,"" as he described his long-sought role. As it unfolded, the trip had its own portents, a mix of the serious and the petty, of the skill and squalor that were to epitomize Nixon's presidency.  He took off from Washington on the morning of Feb. 23, 1969, with trappings of power that came to mark his many travels - a fulsome departure ceremony, White House planes jammed with a party of 300, and Nixon himself ensconced in his forward office on Air Force One, wearing a maroon smoking jacket and surrounded by bulging blue briefing books emblazoned in gold with the presidential seal. He would sit alone there for most of the flight, reading and scribbling notes on his ubiquitous yellow legal pads. It was a solitude broken on this trip by only one interruption, and that, too, was indicative of much to come.    For the new president, a foreign trip was a chance to demonstrate his stature as a statesman - and revealed the insecurities that destroyed his career.  Not long before his departure, the North Vietnamese had launched an offensive in central South Vietnam. In the worn rhythm of the Vietnam War, the operation was a predictable counter to intensified attacks by American forces over the previous three months. But the fighting more than doubled the weekly toll of Americans killed-in-action to 453, and Nixon took it as ""a personal slap in the face,"" especially as he began his coveted European tour. They were hardly into the seven-hour flight when the president, furious as he read the latest intelligence, called in his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger. He told Kissinger that they would proceed with a retaliatory project that had been repeatedly urged by the U.S. military: the secret B-52 bombing of North Vietnamese staging areas in neighboring Cambodia.   In earlier Washington discussions, Secretary of State William Rogers had opposed the bombing as an extension of the war, while Defense Secretary Melvin Laird approved of the raids but objected to keeping them secret. Still, Nixon was determined to strike back, and to keep it covert. To evade what he called his ""shilly-shallying"" cabinet officers as well as public or diplomatic outcry over the bombing of a neutral country, his mid-Atlantic order set off a furtive sequence.   Col. Alexander Haig, then an aide on the security council, and an Air Force colonel were to fly at once from Washington to meet Kissinger at the trip's first stop in Brussels, starting a plan of ""total secrecy"" hidden even from the Strategic Air Command, with B-52 pilots told they were still bombing South Vietnam.   But then initial discussions with Washington made plain that the deception could not be managed quickly. By the time Air Force One landed, a still-seething Nixon had to put off the decision. In remarks to King Baudouin and a cheering crowd at Brussels' Zaventem Airport, as in a much-applauded speech to NATO the next day extolling ""international conciliation,"" there was no hint of the president's in-flight rage and intrigue. This stark contrast between public image and private reality was to be another common pattern in the years ahead.  From Brussels he went on to still more satisfying triumph in London. Over a two-decade career with plentiful critics, Nixon had known none more scathing than Britain's John Freeman, a Labor Party politician and editor of the New Statesman. In what some saw as a diplomatic swipe, Prime Minister Harold Wilson, also of Labor, had recently named Freeman the new British ambassador to Washington, even with the frequent butt of his scorn headed for the White House. But now at a private dinner with Wilson, Freeman and other dignitaries at 10 Downing, and armed with a toast written by his speechwriter (and future New York Times columnist) William Safire, the president gracefully moved past the old animus, at least outwardly. ""They say there's a new Nixon . . . and a new Freeman,"" he told a somewhat tense company. ""Let me set aside all possibility of embarrassment because our roles have changed. He's the new diplomat and I'm the new statesman."" Hands patting the table, Wilson called Nixon ""a born gentleman"" and handed him a personal note jotted on the evening's menu: ""That was one of the kindest and most generous acts I have known in a quarter-century in politics.""  In London as elsewhere, there were embarrassing incidents involving the president's sheer physical clumsiness. In the midst of impressing the British Cabinet with a review of world politics, he fumblingly turned over an inkwell on an heirloom table. (On his return to the White House he would soon ban any soup being served at state dinners, since he almost invariably dribbled it on himself or the table.)   But the awkward manner went unnoticed with his generally deft performance, including an audience with Queen Elizabeth reported by Buckingham Palace to be ""obviously enjoyable to all parties."" He was ""under no illusions that grand tours or . . . a 'new spirit' would resolve basic differences between adversaries or even allies,"" the president had told Congressional leaders. Yet with Wilson, and in NATO discussions, he glossed over contentious issues, and seized on the prime minister's impression from talks with Soviet leaders of a deepening Russian hostility toward China, a breach Nixon fully intended to exploit.  Illusions or no, menu notes and cordial meetings were ephemeral. ""Wilson's a pipe-smoking clown,"" Nixon would tell aides later that year, ""and that Freeman's a real sonofabitch."" But in the public relations glow of the trip, candor could wait. Talking to aides back in the White House Situation Room as the party left Britain, Kissinger was already mocking in a tone that would become habitual. ""Our president is saying he's made a real breakthrough for world peace,"" he told them. ""That's what you can tell your friends in the press whether anyone believes it or not.""  After similarly ""successful"" stops in Bonn, Berlin and Rome, the high point of the eight-day trip was Paris and the imperious 79-year-old French president whom Nixon called, without artifice, ""a giant among men."" In a scarred and scarring life in which Richard Nixon would recognize few peers and fewer heroes, he genuinely admired Charles de Gaulle. As with so much of the Nixon mentality, the esteem came with a complex set of motives rooted deep in his history, and it was destined to have dramatic effect on his own presidency.
