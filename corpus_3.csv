Turkey’s Rules,"In the fall of 2009, relations between Serbia and Bosnia — never easy since the savage civil war of the 1990s — were slipping toward outright hostility. Western mediation efforts had failed. Ahmet Davutoglu, the foreign minister of Turkey, offered to step in. It was a complicated role for Turkey, not least because Bosnia is, like Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country and Serbia is an Orthodox Christian nation with which Turkey had long been at odds. But Davutoglu had shaped Turkey’s ambitious foreign policy according to a principle he called “zero problems toward neighbors.” Neither Serbia nor Bosnia actually shares a border with Turkey. Davutoglu, however, defined his neighborhood expansively, as the vast space of former Ottoman dominion. “In six months,” Davutoglu told me in one of a series of conversations this past fall, “I visited Belgrade five times, Sarajevo maybe seven times.” He helped negotiate names of acceptable diplomats and the language of a Serbian apology for the atrocities in Srebrenica. Bosnia agreed, finally, to name an ambassador to Serbia. To seal the deal, as Davutoglu tells the tale, he met late one night at the Sarajevo airport with the Bosnian leader Haris Silajdzic. The Bosnian smoked furiously. Davutoglu, a pious Muslim, doesn’t smoke — but he made an exception: “I smoked; he smoked.” Silajdzic accepted the Serbian apology. Crisis averted. Davutoglu calls this diplomatic style “smoking like a Bosnian.”",2011-01-21 02:25:57+00:00

The End of AfPak,"Remember how after 9/11, Osama bin Laden’s attacks on us could be linked to almost anything, from shopping habits to the rediscovery of Western values to carbon-pricing schemes?  Something similar appears to be happening with Bin Laden’s death. Jihadism sure isn’t what it used to be. After 10 years, it seems, the time has come to go home. Troops are and will be coming back to the United States from Iraq and Afghanistan. The military budget will be cut. The outgoing secretary of defense feels able to openly mock NATO because, presumably, he thinks he can afford to — because it doesn’t matter all that much. The global war on terror is being downgraded from Armageddon to something more out of Leviticus: a tricked-out police action, just as John Kerry, in this magazine, always said it should be. On Sunday, Helene Cooper and Mark Landler reported that “American success in the counterterrorism campaign would seem to bolster arguments for a swift withdrawal from Afghanistan.” By Tuesday morning, they were reporting that President Obama would announce his withdrawal plans on Wednesday. Meanwhile, a Harris poll revealed that 51 percent of Americans and 54 percent of Britons believed “the death of Bin Laden meant it was time to bring troops from their countries home.”",2011-06-21 21:44:28+00:00

Seize the Moment in North Korea,"The world outside North Korea appears to be more unhinged by the sudden death of Kim Jong-il than the country he ruled over for 17 years. There are certainly good reasons to worry about the prospect of his 27-year-old son, Kim Jong-un, taking the reins of a belligerent nuclear armed state. The United States must for this reason clearly hedge against the downside risks. But there are equally good reasons to assume that the succession will proceed smoothly and thus the United States should also be prepared to explore the upside opportunities.",2011-12-22 12:36:28+00:00

The Pakistanis Have a Point,"The article by Bill Keller is an incisive and balanced analysis of what has brought the Pakistan-United States relationship to its low point. Both sides have no clear understanding of the vital interests of the other. For Pakistan, it is not in its interest to antagonize the Taliban, who are sure to come back to power in Afghanistan once the Americans leave, but at the very least, it can prevent the Taliban from attacking U.S. and NATO forces from its soil and not give any support in the planning and execution of such attacks. On the other hand, the U.S. fails to understand how alarming it is for Pakistan, and rightfully so, to see the growing strengthening of the India-Afghanistan axis, both its bitter enemies. Successive Afghan governments since the day that Pakistan was created have maintained a very hostile attitude except for the few years under Taliban rule. Therefore, in order not to have two unfriendly neighbors, Pakistan has chosen to bet on the return of the Taliban.",2011-12-30 17:14:15+00:00
