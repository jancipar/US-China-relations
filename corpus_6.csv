The rig is run by China National Offshore Oil Corporation, or Cnooc, and lies just 120 nautical miles off the main coastline of Vietnam. Chinese ships have fired water cannons at the Vietnamese vessels, and both sides have said their ships have been rammed by opposing forces.

Anger Grows in Vietnam Over Dispute With China,"HANOI, Vietnam — Thousands of workers rampaged through an industrial area in southern Vietnam on Tuesday in what reportedly began as protests against China’s stationing of an oil rig in disputed waters off of Vietnam’s coast.  The riots were some of the worst civil unrest in recent years and appear to have prompted  restraints on the local media by Vietnam’s authoritarian government. An article about the protests that was posted online by a Vietnamese state newspaper on Tuesday was removed by Wednesday morning.  The Chinese Embassy in Hanoi issued a notice on Wednesday that urged Chinese living in Vietnam to “minimize unnecessary outings.”  A staff member at the Chutex Garment Factory north of Ho Chi Minh City said 8,000 to 10,000 workers were involved in the rampage at his factory.  “They burned the office,” said the staff member who agreed to speak on condition that his name not be used. The rioters “burned everything, all of the materials, computers, machines.”  Police units and fire fighters arrived at the factory Tuesday and “disbanded,” the rioters, he said. On Wednesday morning police “captured” around 15 to 20 men who were attempting to loot the premises, he said.  The Chutex factory, located in Song Than Industrial Park 2 in southern Binh Duong Province, is described on its web site as one of the largest garment exporters in Vietnam. Chutex International, the parent company, was founded by a Taiwanese garment executive.  It is unclear why rioters targeted a factory linked to Taiwan. Media in Hong Kong said  workers might not have been distinguishing between mainland China and Taiwan, a self-governing island which also has claims to territory in the South China Sea.",2014-05-14 04:21:22+00:00

He did not underplay the difficulties, or the implacability of a deal’s opponents in Iran and the United States, but suggested the “short-lived dustbowl” thrown up by any resolution would dissipate as win-win awareness grew. He even alluded to the aroma of roses. It was a polished performance full of the subtleties intrinsic to the Iranian mind.
